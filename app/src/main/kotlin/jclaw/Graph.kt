 * The JNation cut showed a hand-drawn diagram of this graph, and the honest
 * caveat on stage was "my diagram was static". This one is not: Koog walks the
 * actual strategy object - the same one the app runs - and emits a Mermaid
 * state diagram. Change an edge and the picture changes, because there is no
 * picture, only the graph.
 *
 *   gradle :app:graph
 *
 * Writes pipeline.mmd, which IntelliJ renders in the Markdown/Mermaid preview.
